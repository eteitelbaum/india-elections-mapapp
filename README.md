# Mapping Ruling Coalitions in India

## WebApp
This project aims to provide detailed and accurate data visualization of ruling coalitions in India. The web applications that will result from it will provide people interested in the evolution of the Indian political landscape with a centralized tool to observe it. 

## General Elections (Lok Sabha) Winners 
The first tool of this web application will be an interactive map displaying the winning party of each General Election in every constituency since 1977[^1].

## State-Level Ruling Coalitions
The second tool of this web application will be an interactive map displaying the ruling party or in every Indian state and UT since 1980-2021[^2]. 

#### Difficulties
- State boundaries change often, on the contrary of assembly constituencies
- State elections do not occur simultaneously
